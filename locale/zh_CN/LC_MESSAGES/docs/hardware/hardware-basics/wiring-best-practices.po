"Vibration Isolation - Make sure to isolate any components which create "
"excessive vibration, such as compressors, using \"vibration isolators\". "
"This will help reduce vibration on the robot which can loosen fasteners and "
"cause premature fatigue failure on some electronic components."
msgstr ""
"隔振 - 确保使用隔振器来隔离任何产生过度振动的组件，比如压缩机。这会有助于减少机器整体上的振动，否则，振动会使紧固件松动，并导致某些电子组件过早失效。"

"Bumpers - Use Bumpers to cover as much of the robot as possible for your "
"design. While the rules require specific bumper coverage around the corners "
"of your robot, maximizing the use of bumpers increases the likelihood that "
"all collisions will be damped by your bumpers. Bumpers significantly reduce "
"the g-forces experienced in a collision compared to hitting directly on a "
"hard robot surface, reducing the shock experienced by the electronics and "
"decreasing the chance of a shock related failure."
msgstr ""
"保险杠 - "
"使用保险杠来尽量多的覆盖您所设计的机器人。虽然规则上要求在机器人的各个边角处覆盖特定的保险杠，但是最大程度的使用保险杠会大大提高所有碰撞被保险杠缓冲的概率。与直接撞击机器人坚硬的表面相比，保险杠大大的降低了在冲撞时所承受的力量，进而减少了电子设备所受到的冲击，进而降低了相关故障发生的可能性。"

"Shock Mounting - You may choose to shock mount some or all of your "
"electronic components to further reduce the forces they see in robot "
"collisions. This is especially helpful for the robot radio and other "
"electronics such as co-processors, which may not be designed for use on "
"mobile platforms. Vibration isolators, springs, foams, or mounting to "
"flexible materials all may reduce the shock forces seen by these components."
msgstr ""
"避震安装 - "
"您可以选择对某些或全部电子组件进行避震安装，以进一步减小他们在机器人冲撞过程中受到的力量。这对于机器人的无线电以及其他电子组件，例如协处理器尤其有用，因为它们也许并不是专门为了适用于移动的平台而设计的，将这些组件安装到隔振器，弹簧，泡沫或其他柔性材料上都可以减少这些组件所受到的冲击力。"

"Unfortunately there are few places in the FRC Control System where "
"redundancy is feasible. Taking advantage of opportunities for redundancy can"
" increase reliability. The primary example of this is wiring the barrel "
"connector to the radio in addition to the provided PoE connection. This "
"ensures that if one of the cables becomes damaged or dislodged, the other "
"will maintain power to the radio. Keep an eye out for other potential areas "
"to provide redundancy when wiring and programming your robot."
msgstr ""
"不幸的是，在FRC控制系统中，很少有冗余是有用的。有时候，利用冗余可能提高可靠性。一个主要示例是将桶型连接器连接到无线电，还有提供PoE连接。这样就可以确保如果其中有一根电缆损坏或者脱落，另一根电缆将保持无线电的供电。留意其他有机会使用冗余的区域，以确保在您连接和编写机器人代码的时候使用它。"
