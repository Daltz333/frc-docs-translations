"“Command-based” programming is an example of what is known as a `design "
"pattern. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern>`__ It is a general "
"way of organizing one’s robot code that is well-suited to a particular "
"problem-space. It is not the only way to write a robot program, but it is a "
"very effective one; command-based robot code tends to be clean, extensible, "
"and (with some tricks) easy to re-use from year to year."
msgstr ""
"\"Command-based\" 编程是所谓的 `design pattern. "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern>`__ 的一个示例。 "
"这是一种整理归纳机器人代码的通用方法。尽管这不是编写机器人程序的唯一方法，但它非常有效；command-based "
"机器人代码趋向于整洁，可扩展，并且易于年复一年地重复使用 (需要一些技巧)。"
