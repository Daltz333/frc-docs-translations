"If you had a coprocessor and wanted to have a set of tables that's shared "
"only between the coprocessor and the robot, you could set up a separate "
"instance in the robot code that acts as a client (or a server) and connect "
"the coprocessor to it, and those tables will NOT be sent to the dashboard."
msgstr ""
"如果您有一个协处理器，并且希望有一组仅在协处理器和机器人之间共享的表，则可以在机器人代码中设置一个单独的实例来充当客户端（或服务器）并将协处理器连接到该实例。这些表将不会发送到仪表盘程序。"
