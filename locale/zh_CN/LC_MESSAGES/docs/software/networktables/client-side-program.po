"If all you need to do is have your robot program communicate with GRIP or a "
"dashboard running on the Driver Station laptop, then the previous examples "
"of writing robot programs are sufficient. But if you would like to write "
"some custom client code that would run on the drivers station or on a "
"coprocessor then you need to know how to build Network Tables programs for "
"those (non-roboRIO) platforms."
msgstr ""
"如果您需要做的仅是让机器人程序与GRIP或在Driver "
"Station笔记本电脑上运行的仪表板通信，那么前面编写机器人程序的示例就足够了。但是，如果您想编写一些可在Driver "
"Station或协处理器上运行的自定义客户端代码，您需要知道如何为那些（非roboRIO）平台构建网络表程序。"

"In this example an instance of NetworkTables is created and a "
"NetworkTableEntry if created to reference the values of \"x\" and \"y\" from"
" a table called \"datatable\"."
