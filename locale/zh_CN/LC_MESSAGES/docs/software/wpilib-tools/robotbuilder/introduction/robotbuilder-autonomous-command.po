"Since a command is simply one or more actions (behaviors) that the robot "
"performs, it makes sense to describe the autonomous operation of a robot as "
"a command. While it could be a single command, it is more likely going to be"
" a command group (a group of commands that happen together)."
msgstr ""
"由于一个指令仅仅是机器人执行的一个或多个行动（行为），将机器人的自动运行描述成一个指令很有道理。虽然它可以是一个指令，它更可能是一个指令组（一组一起执行的指令）。"
