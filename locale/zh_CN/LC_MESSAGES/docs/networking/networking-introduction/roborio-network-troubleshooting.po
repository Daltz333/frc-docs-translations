"The first step to identifying roboRIO networking issues is to isolate if it "
"is an application issue or a general network issue. To do this, click "
"**Start -> type cmd -> press Enter** to open the command prompt. Type ``ping"
" roboRIO-####-FRC.local`` where #### is your team number (with no leading "
"zeroes) and press enter. If the ping succeeds, the issue is likely with the "
"specific application, verify your team number configuration in the "
"application, and check your firewall configuration."

"识别roboRIO网络问题的第一步是隔离如果其是应用程序问题或常规网络问题的话。为此，请单击**开始->输入cmd->按Enter "

"roboRIO-####-FRC.local``，其中####是您的团队编号（没有前导零），然后按Enter键。如果ping操作成功，则可能是特定应用程序出现了问题，请在应用程序中验证您的团队编号配置，然后检查防火墙配置。"
